This document will attempt to explain the evolution of the Geography of Hyrule through the course of the games.

Considering that this game will be based in the Era of the Hero of Time during the Hyrulean Civil War/Interloper War,
the maps only span from the Creation Era into the Shadow Era.

The game developers of this series do not seem entirely concerned with geographical continuity.
While there are common factors in many of the maps, many places seem to change places entirely,
new places appear out of nowhere, and entire landmasses can just disappear with no explanation.

First, we will identify the common factors in many of the maps:

-The kingdom's capital is always in the center of the map
	Skyloft/Hyrule Castle
-A volcano is typically in the northern half of the map
	Eldin Volcano/Death Mountain
-A lake has existed in every corner of the kingdom at some point
	Lake Floria/Hylia
-A forest has changed names and locations with every game
	Faron Woods/Minish Woods/Kokiri Forest/Lost Woods
-A desert is typically in the western portion of the map
	Lanayru Desert/Gerudo Desert
-A village is typically in the eastern portion of the map
	Kakariko Village
-A ranch typically exists somewhere to provide the hero with his horse
	Lon-Lon Ranch/Ordon Ranch
-Ancient Temples in reverence to the Godesses are in every corner of the kingdom
	Temple of Time/Forest Temple/Fire Temple/Water Temple/Shadow Temple/Spirit Temple/
-A snowy mountain in the northwest portion of the map, above Lake Hylia

Skyward Sword, Ocarina of Time, and Twilight Princess are all very similar.
We will use the map from Twilight Princess as a model.

On to the history of the geographical locations of Hyrule:

Lake Floria is later renamed Lake Hylia when Hyrule becomes a united kingdom
The Gerudo rename Lanayru Desert as Gerudo Desert, as per a treaty with the throne
The Faron Woods later become known as the Lost Woods, also known to some as the Minish Woods, the Kokiri Forest is deep within
Eldin Volcano becomes known as Death Mountain
The Province of Ordona is discovered south of the Lost Woods
