   -Added alot of music to concept/ceigemaster
Edits:
   -edited the .gitignore to ignore temporary backup files created by windows

Removals:
   -Emptied AssetsMod of all unused assets

Notes:
   -Was originally going to just be TestWizard, but there was a naming conflict within the engine
   -The naming conflict still exists, perhaps because we are defining an animated sprite in the wrong way
   -LordTestWizard is far too big, his other four animations aren't set, and his WalkWest animation plays even while idle
   -LordTestWizard was created from the DeadlyReef module (T2D Master), and as such still contains some references to it
